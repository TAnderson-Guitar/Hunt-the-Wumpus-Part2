13/06/2025 - Continued further with code, i soon reliased that this project will not be able to be completed in one night
I also made all the rooms that i need for the game it took basically the whole lesson to do what the frick man
16/06/2025 - Continued further again with my code, I finished off all the names and descriptions of the classrooms, I began to start to link all the classrooms together
i do not know why my code is broken i am quite angry with it as well as scared because i dont want to waste time if what im doing doesnt work at all
My brain also was super clouded when linking the caves and i almost did east and west backwards but i pasted a compass in the sheets so that i knew the correct direction
I also added the hallway as a room just so it makes more sense for the people
17/06/2025 - I went through all my code attempting to understand everything, this lesson i went through and fixed all my linking stuff
I added the miss earl character as the wumpus. Some annoying things were when i did all the linking and it was actually not correct
So then i spent the remainder of the lesson fixing everything and being sad but it gave me ideas. Im also glad that my code now works
My idea includes making more charcters like goodies, potential item drops and possibly a quest giver. Bradley gave me and idea for an inventory.
18/06/2025 - i added the clear console command, i also made the npc sub class for quest and i added the mr cole as a character
it was also really confusing when making it because i couldnt remember what actually to do
25/07/2025 - Today i finished linking the hall to the main array of classrooms i also linked all the areas in the hall as well and came up with ideas for characters to add and quests to do.
I will add mr cole, jarron and alec waterson in each of their places. Mr cole in his room, jarron in the audio rack and alec waterson in the middle room plugging leads into the sound desk.
our job is to stop him and teach him to correct ways.
