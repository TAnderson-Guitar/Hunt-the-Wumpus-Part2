13/06/2025 - Continued further with code, i soon reliased that this project will not be able to be completed in one night
I also made all the rooms that i need for the game it took basically the whole lesson to do what the frick man
16/06/2025 - Continued further again with my code, I finished off all the names and descriptions of the classrooms, I began to start to link all the classrooms together
i do not know why my code is broken i am quite angry with it as well as scared because i dont want to waste time if what im doing doesnt work at all
My brain also was super clouded when linking the caves and i almost did east and west backwards but i pasted a compass in the sheets so that i knew the correct direction
I also added the hallway as a room just so it makes more sense for the people
